Invoice++ , (c) 2011 Scott Girling
==========


I designed and developed this website for my final assignment at college. 
It's not a fully working example of an invoice management system, but demonstrates PHP, MySQL and JavaScript coding using basic invoicing and business setup ideas. 
This website was tested in Firefox 4 and may have some CSS and AJAX issues in older browsers.

To use the website locally:

PRESTEP) Move invoice_plusplus into htdocs (or where you're running your local webserver) and import invoice_plusplus.sql for database.

1) Go to http://localhost/invoice_pluplus/

2) Sign up.

3) *COPY* the password that you are given after you click the sign up button.

4) Login using the email you used to sign up and the password you were given.

5) Play with site.
